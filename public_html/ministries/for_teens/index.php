					<h1>MINISTRIES FOR TEENS</h1>
					<p>
						We believe in your Students. Setting a firm foundation in Christ as they embark on their teenage years is one of our major goals at Calvary. Students will 
						learn to rely on God even during the really tough times, when they might not understand why things are happening to them. Establishing that trust now will 
						encourage them to live with a biblical worldview. We all remember what it was like when we were teenagers. Our safe and fun atmospheres allow students to 
						open up and experience the life of Jesus Christ.

						<h2>The Well</h2>
						<p>More than a ministry…it’s a movement!</p>
						<p>
							God has given us a mandate to inspire and direct a generation into a burning relationship with God through Christ.  As a result of the fire that
							burns in the hearts of young people, an awakening will occur that will change our families, schools, churches and ultimately our nation.
						</p>

						<p>
							The Well is an active and exciting experience that your student does not want to miss. The Well urges your students in 6th-12th grades to join us for incredible,
							life-changing and sometimes wild services. We use relatable topics, youthful illustrations and exciting worship to grow and build the next generation of Christ followers.
						</p>
						<h3 style="text-align:center;">Wednesdays at 6:30pm</h3>
						<!--<p>Come early and join us at 4pm for <b>The Feast</b>. Our team always serves up some of the tastiest food around!</p>-->
						
						<p>If you would like to <b>serve</b> on The Well staff, click the "serve" button on the right.</p>

						<h2>The Furnace</h2>
						<p>
							One of the values of Calvary Church and The Well is prayer. The Furnace is a youth prayer movement contending for the hearts of this generation through intercession. 
							Each week we teach the principles of prayer and God’s heart to answer those prayers and then we implement what we have learned.  We believe God is stirring a young 
							generation and His church to pray His heart so that we will see His will done on earth.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you have a student that would like to attend, please <a href="/contact/#general">let us know</a> he or she is coming. If you would like to support this ministry in other ways, you could make a donation by clicking the "give to ministry" button on the right.
						</p>
						<h3 style="text-align:center;">Wednesdays from 5:55pm - 6:25pm.</h3>

						<h2>Youth Small Groups</h2>

They meet on different nights of the week so check with the youth office for times and the location that works best for you.

					</div>
					
					
					<div id="hash05" class="hashhide">
						<h2>MORE</h2>
						<p>
							Students spend most of their lives seeing and experiencing things on the surface.  More is the small group gathering where students
							are given an opportunity to discuss what God has been speaking to them through the sermons at The Well.  All middle school and high school
							students are welcome to join us as we embark on a journey to discover MORE. We gather on Thursdays at various homes at 6pm. Call the youth
							office at 352.637.5100 ext. 122 for MORE locations.
